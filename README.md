Bundled with hardhat, ethers and waffle.

To use:

1. Install all dependencies `npm install`
2. Compile with `npm run compile`
3. Test with `npm run test`
4. Deploy to hardhat local network with `npm run deploy`
5. Deploy to test network, for example rinkeby by `npm run deploy -- --network rinkeby`

**Note:** Make sure to add the `RINKEBY_PROVIDER_API_KEY` and `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` to your `.env` file. More networks can be added to the `hardhat.config.js` file.
